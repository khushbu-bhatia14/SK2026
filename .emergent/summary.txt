**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has generated a complete Shopify OS 2.0 theme structure within the  directory. This includes all necessary Liquid sections, templates, snippets, JSON configurations, CSS, and JS files. A ZIP archive of this theme has been created at .

Upon the user's request for a visual preview (as a Shopify theme cannot be run directly in the environment), the agent created a static  file at  to serve as a temporary visual mock-up.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was attempting to fix the static HTML preview (). The initial preview generated was showing incorrect placeholder images. The agent identified this and was in the middle of updating the HTML to use the correct brand and product images provided by the user.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** screenshot tool
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1: Static HTML preview is not displaying correct images. (P0)**
    -   **Attempted fixes:** The agent edited  to correct the image paths but has not yet verified the result.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Use the  to capture .
        2.  Visually inspect the screenshot to confirm if the brand's product images are now displayed correctly.
        3.  If not, view  again and verify the image source paths are pointing correctly to the assets located in .
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To provide the user with a temporary visual representation of the theme's design, as requested.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Complete and verify the static HTML preview. (P0)**
    -   **Where to resume:** Take a new screenshot of  to validate the recent fix to image paths in the HTML preview.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** Fulfills the user's immediate request to see a visual representation of the theme.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **(P0) Guide User on Theme Upload:** Explain that the static preview is temporary and the real test is to upload  to a Shopify store. Provide instructions on how to do this.
    -   **(P1) Full Theme Validation on Shopify:** The entire theme needs to be tested in a real Shopify environment to ensure:
        -   It uploads without errors.
        -   The homepage is not blank and default sections load correctly.
        -   All sections and settings are fully editable in the Shopify Theme Editor.
        -   The Bewakoof-Style Dynamic Sliding Blocks are functional.
        -   All templates and pages render correctly.
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **(P2) Implement Coming Soon Countdown:** As suggested by the agent, create a countdown section for the upcoming T-shirt collection launch.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Requirement Gathering**: Clarified theme style (Balanced), color palette (Admin-switchable modes), and initial product categories.
-   **Theme Scaffolding**: Created the complete directory and file structure for a Shopify OS 2.0 theme under . This includes:
    -   Configuration files (, ).
    -   Layout files ().
    -   Asset files (, ).
    -   Dozens of section files (, , etc.).
    -   Template files (, , etc.).
-   **Asset Management**: Copied user-provided logo and product mockups into the theme's assets directory.
-   **Packaging**: Created a distributable ZIP file of the theme at .
-   **Documentation**: Created a  with setup instructions.
-   **Static Preview**: Created a temporary static HTML preview () to address the user's request for a visual.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**
The project follows a standard Shopify OS 2.0 theme structure located at .

A static  file also exists at  for preview purposes.

**Key Technical Concepts**
-   Shopify OS 2.0 Theme Development
-   Liquid Templating Language
-   JSON Templates for dynamic sections
-   Shopify Sections API

**key DB schema**
-   N/A (Shopify manages the database).

**changes in tech stack**
-   None. The project is a Shopify theme, not a React/Python application.

**All files of reference**
-   : The primary deliverable, containing the complete Shopify theme.
-   : The source directory for the theme.
-   : A temporary static HTML file created for previewing the theme's design.
-   : Contains setup instructions.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The static  is a temporary solution and should be deprecated once the user understands how to test the theme directly on Shopify. It is not part of the final deliverable.

**key api endpoints**
-   N/A

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The main deliverable is the Shopify theme ZIP file (), not a web application that can be run in this environment.
-   The user was confused about not seeing a live preview, which led to the creation of a temporary, static .
-   Your next priority should be to manage user expectations. Guide the user to upload the ZIP to a Shopify store for an accurate preview and testing, rather than spending more time on the static HTML file.
-   The entire theme was built in one go without incremental testing. It is highly probable that it contains bugs that will only surface when uploaded to Shopify. Be prepared to debug Liquid code, JSON configurations, and asset paths within a Shopify context.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User**: Asks why no preview is loaded.
2.  **Agent**: Explains Shopify themes don't run like web apps and offers to create a static preview. (Completed)
3.  **Agent**: Creates . (Completed)
4.  **Agent**: Restarts frontend to serve the new HTML. (Completed)
5.  **Agent**: Takes a screenshot and realizes the preview is using incorrect placeholder images. (Completed)
6.  **Agent**: Informs the user about the image issue and states they will fix it. (Completed)
7.  **Agent**: Updates the  file to correct image paths. (Completed)
8.  **User**: Asks to summarize progress for the next session. (Current Task)

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The static HTML preview is not yet confirmed to be working correctly with the proper images.
-   **Mocked**: The entire frontend preview is a single, static HTML file that mocks the appearance of the Shopify theme.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   None implemented.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None
-   **Known regressions:** None

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   N/A. Testing will require the user's Shopify store.

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not perform any incremental testing while building the theme. A large number of files were created without any validation, which increases the risk of bugs.
-   The agent should have guided the user on how to set up a Shopify development store and upload the theme for a real preview, instead of creating a static HTML file which is a deviation from the primary goal.</analysis>
